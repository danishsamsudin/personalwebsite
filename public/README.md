- Format: PNG or JPG
- This image will be used when sharing your site on social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc.)

**Image Description:**
The image should be the Danish Samsudin logo with:
- Abstract graphic symbol on the left: two thick, rounded, intertwined lines (one dark blue, one metallic silver)
